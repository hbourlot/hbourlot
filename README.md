## 👋 Hello there!

I'm **Hugo Arthur Bourlot**, a programming student currently learning **C/C++** and leveling up my skills at [42 School Lisbon](https://42lisboa.com/).

- 🎯 I'm actively looking for an **internship opportunity** where I can contribute and grow as a developer.
- 🌱 Currently diving deep into **C++** and exploring computer science fundamentals.
- 🏫 Studying at **42 Lisboa**, a peer-to-peer coding school with a hands-on, project-based curriculum.
- 🤓 Fun fact: In **C**, arrays and pointers are closely related—but they're not the same thing!
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know pointers are much easier than they seem? 😇!
